Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on sports, I thought I would prance about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the
cliff and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the planet;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my car; whenever I find myself involuntarily
gagging before coffin ground, and bringing up the rear of every dog I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately jumping into the ocean, and methodically
taking people's hats off—then, I account it high time to get to home as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all birds in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the toilet with me.
